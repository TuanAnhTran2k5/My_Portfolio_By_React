              üë®‚Äçüíª Hello, my name is Tuan Anh. I am currently studying Information
              Technology at FPT University. I started programming at a very
              early age and gradually realized that I have a special interest in
              creating technology products.
            </p>
            <p>
              ‚ú® In addition to studying in class, I focus on self-studying more
              about web programming - from HTML, CSS, JavaScript to modern
              frameworks. Every time I complete a small website, I feel very
              happy because I see my idea become a real product.
            </p>
            <p>
              üöÄ My goal in the near future is to build more personal projects
              and learn more about creating apps and games to practice and learn
              more new skills, It helps me to gradually become a professional
              software engineer.
